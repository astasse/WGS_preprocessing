# Whole genome sequencing pre-processing

This document covers the necessary steps to pre-process whole genome sequence read data. 
This pipeline is optimized for the Brown Ecological Genetics lab at UNH, but can be applied elsewhere with modifications.
At the end, SNPs are called and downstream analyses are able to be used.
